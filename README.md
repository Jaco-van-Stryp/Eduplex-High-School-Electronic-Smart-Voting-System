# Eduplex High School Electronic Smart Voting System
This application was developed for Eduplex Highschool

The goal of this application was to create a way where all students could come together and vote
for the students they want to see become their leaders. 
This program was designed to run smoothly on any computer or server you throw at it.
Every Computer has a copy of the executable file while the main database has the server data. 
Processing is done afterwards to prevent the system crashing while everyone is voting.

NOTE - This application was designed for Eduplex High School by an Eduplex High School Student
